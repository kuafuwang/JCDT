现在JCIDE已经迁移到LSP模式的构架,这些库适用于JCIDE 3.xx版本. 5.0之后的就不采用这个库了.当做纪念吧.这些库写的很辛苦,它帮助了我的成长.

It is a another version of JDT.
This is the core part of JCIDE's Java development tools. It contains the non-UI support for compiling and working with Java code, including the following:

* an incremental or batch Java compiler which comes from jlikes
* Java source and class file indexer and search infrastructure
* APIs for code assist, access to the AST and structured manipulation of Java source.

For more information and important links, refer to the [Jlikes] [1] or the [JCIDE page] [2].
